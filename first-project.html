        <h2 class="categoryTitle">Health and Fitness</h2>
        <p class="categoryDescription"> As a Public Health Major and someone who is very interested in medicine, I understand the importance of being healthy. I enjoy researching and taking preventative health measures such as, making better food decisions, implementing functional training when I exercise and maintaining optimal hygiene daily. Did you know? In 1846 (Vienna,Austria) babies and mothers were dying due to the lack of hand washing from physicians. Its the small things that makes a difference.</p>

        <h2 class="categoryTitle">Anime</h2>
        <p class="categoryDescription">I Know what you may be thinking. Another anime newbie (if you've been watching it for a while) nahh, not me. From Inuyasha to the sad and pathetic Boruto. I have been watching anime since 2002 and i love it till this day. My top 5 anime of all time would probably be; Naruto, One Piece, Death Note, Cowboy Bebop and Bleach. What makes anime so great is that, it bring the inner child out of you and believe it or not it has tons of wisdom that you can apply to you life. What makes a great anime you might ask? Well like any other show, it needs a good story; one with loads of charater development and growth. </p>

        <p class="categoryDescription"> As you get older, you have to redefine your fun. For me its reading a good book or playing Basketball. But, what i truly enjoy is getting dressed up and dining at nice resturaunts or traveling around world and dining at nice resturaunts. I recently tried some oyester and now I am Hooked! </p>
